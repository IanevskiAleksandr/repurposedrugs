# RepurposeDrugs: an interactive web-based data portal and predictive platform for repurposing mono- and combination therapies

<p style="text-align:justify;"> <b>RepurposeDrugs</b> RepurposeDrugs (https://repurposedrugs.org/) is a comprehensive web-portal that combines a unique drug indication database with a machine learning (ML) predictor to discover new drug-indication associations for approved as well as investigational mono and combination therapies. The platform provides detailed information on treatment status, disease indications, and clinical trials across 25 disease categories, including neoplasms and cardiovascular conditions. The current version comprises  4,314 compounds (approved, terminated, or investigational) and 161 drug combinations linked to 1,756 indications/conditions, totalling 28,148 drug-disease indication pairs. By leveraging data on both approved and failed indications, RepurposeDrugs provides ML-based predictions for potential drug-disease indications, both for mono- and combinatorial therapies, demonstrating high predictive accuracy in cross-validation.</p>
